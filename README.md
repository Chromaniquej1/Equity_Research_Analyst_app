# Equity Research Analyst Application

This project leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to provide data-driven insights for equity research analysis. The application assists users by analyzing financial data, predicting market trends, and generating comprehensive reports on stocks and companies. It is designed to help analysts and investors make informed decisions through interactive dashboards, similarity searches, and advanced language model-driven analysis.

## Features
- **Financial Data Analysis**: Extract and analyze financial reports, earnings, and market data.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Use machine learning algorithms to predict stock movements and future trends.
- **LLM-Driven Insights**: Generate textual insights and reports on company performance, market trends, and risks.
- **FAISS Similarity Search**: Efficiently find similar companies or financial instruments based on custom metrics like market performance.
- **Langchain-Powered Interactions**: Build advanced workflows and analyses by chaining language model responses.
- **Customizable**: Tailor predictions and insights based on industry, sector, or individual companies.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze news articles, earnings calls, and social media to gauge market sentiment.
- **Interactive Dashboards**: Use Streamlit to visualize data and interact with the models in real-time.

## Technologies Used
- **Large Language Model (LLM)**: [GPT-3.5, GPT-4, etc.] for report generation and textual analysis.
- **Streamlit**: A web framework for building interactive dashboards and deploying the equity research application.
- **FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)**: For fast, efficient similarity searches on financial data and clustering stock data based on features like performance, market trends, etc.
- **Langchain**: For building advanced LLM-based applications and chaining together multiple language model interactions for enhanced analysis.
